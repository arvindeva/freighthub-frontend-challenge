## About
This project is the first time I tried using TypeScript and MobX, so I know the code is not as clean as I want it to be (I'd need more time to practice). It's also the first time I made a react app from scratch (Without using create-react-app, Next, gatsby, etc.) and it took me HOURS. I'm sad that I don't get to do more testing because I tried to make sure that the app actually meets the minimum functionality of the use cases. I'm honestly not too happy with the end result, I know there are so many way to improve the project as a whole, but I did enjoy working on this project because I got to learn sooo many new things, mainly TypeScript and MobX. This is also my first time using styled-system and I realized that using this method really gave me a nice developer experience.


If I could do the project all over again, I would forego some of the "Nice to haves" so that I could focus on actually writing better code since I spent so much time learning webpack, TypeScript, MobX (Don't get me wrong, it wasn't wasted time, the knowledge I gained is invaluable!!, but due to time constraint for this project, I ended up with messy implementation and not tested code).
